# PythonProjects

This repository contains various Python projects that aim to solve different tasks and demonstrate Python programming concepts. Below you will find descriptions of two 
projects included in this repository.

## Project 1: Web Page Header Translator

This Python program takes a blog article or any web page as input and extracts all the headers from that page. It then translates all those headers to French and saves 
them into their own HTML file. The generated HTML file can be opened in a browser, allowing you to view all the headers of the specific blog article translated into 
French.

### Usage

1. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the script by executing the following command:
   ```
   python header_translator.py
   ```

3. Provide the URL of the web page or blog article when prompted.

4. The program will extract the headers, translate them to French, and save them in an HTML file.

## Project 2: Downloads Folder Cleanup

This Python program automates the process of cleaning up your messy downloads folder by identifying files that are older than 30 days or were last used more than 30 days 
ago. It moves these files to a new folder called "to_delete" so that you can review and delete them if needed.

### Usage

1. Run the script by executing the following command:
   ```
   python downloads_cleanup.py
   ```

2. The program will scan your downloads folder and identify files that meet the criteria for deletion.

3. The identified files will be moved to a new folder called "to_delete" within your downloads folder.

4. Review the files in the "to_delete" folder and delete them manually if desired.

Please note that it's always a good practice to review the files in the "to_delete" folder before deleting them permanently, as the program may not accurately determine 
the significance or importance of each file.
